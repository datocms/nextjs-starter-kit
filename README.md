# Next.js Starter Kit

This project aims to be a great starting point for your Next.js projects that need to interact with DatoCMS.

- 🔍 **Fully commented code** — Every file is commented and explained in detail, it will be impossible to get lost!
- 💯 **100% TypeScript** — Thanks to [gql.tada](https://gql-tada.0no.co/) every GraphQL query is fully typed, and your IDE will help you complete the GraphQL queries.
- 🛠️ **Minimal boilerplate** — The project is minimal and exposes only what is necessary to get started, without complicated models that need to be removed.
- 🚫 **Zero CSS** — There is only one CSS import, which you can remove to use your preferred CSS tool.
- 📝 **Full support for Next.js Draft Mode** — Your editors can always view the latest draft version of the content.
- 🧩 **Plugin ready** — Support for the fantastic plugins [Web Previews](https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-web-previews) and [SEO/Readability Analysis](https://www.datocms.com/marketplace/plugins/i/datocms-plugin-seo-readability-analysis).
- 🔄 **DatoCMS's Real-time Updates API** — Your editors can see updated content instantly as soon as you save a new version on DatoCMS.
- 🗑️ **Cache invalidation** — No need to re-deploy your website after each modification to your content, as it will be automatically updated thanks to DatoCMS webhooks.
- 🌐 **SEO Metadata** — Full integration between Next.js and the SEO settings coming from DatoCMS.

## How to use

### Quick start

1. [Create an account on DatoCMS](https://datocms.com).

2. Make sure that you have set up the [Github integration on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github).

3. Let DatoCMS set everything up for you clicking this button below:

[![Deploy with DatoCMS](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.datocms.com/deploy?repo=datocms%2Fnextjs-starter-kit%3Amain)

### Local setup

Once the setup of the project and repo is done, clone the repo locally.

#### Set up environment variables

Copy the sample .env file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

In your DatoCMS' project, go to the **Settings** menu at the top and click **API tokens**.

Copy the values of the following tokens into the specified environment variable:

- `DATOCMS_PUBLISHED_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Published)
- `DATOCMS_DRAFT_CONTENT_CDA_TOKEN`: CDA Only (Draft)
- `DATOCMS_CMA_TOKEN`: CMA Only (Admin)

Then set `SECRET_API_TOKEN` as a sicure string — it will be used to safeguard all route handlers from incoming requests from untrusted sources.

#### Run your project locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your website should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
